THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "rconifers" PACKAGE

Please note that only the most significant changes are reported here.

A full ChangeLog is available in the log messages of the SVN repository.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-8

* A variant was added (CONIFERS_CIPS), developed by Douglas Maguire and 
Doug Mainwaring of Oregon State Universty. More information 
on the CIPS model can be found at http://www.fsl.orst.edu/cips/index.htm
This brings the number of variants in the CONIFERS project, and 
accompanying rconifers package, to four (4).

* removed the strset C function in model_cips.c for the new test compilance 
file output named write_cips_test_file.

* replaced beta cips_calc_[d6/d12]_from_veg_cov_and_height with generic 
taper function named cips_calc_dhi to address ending diameter output issues. 
Required updates to other variants COEFFS arrays too.

* In calc_sdi_mort function, the convergence criteria for the bisection-interval
section in the function, was relaxed to converge for single-precision, not double, 
which was causing projection failures.

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-7

* A variant was added (CONIFERS_SWOHYBRID), developed by Martin Ritchie, of 
USDA FS at PSW Redding, to examine the influence of climate model variables 
in the CONIFERS_SWO simulator variant.

* A preliminary quality assurance test was added by using the examples from the 
R documentation. Not all operating systems and computer architectures will pass. 

* renamed fill_in_missing_values function to impute_missing_values and updated the 
function to accept arguments for new variants. 

* moved coefficients version and model version numbers into coeffs_[var].c files.

* added an output when the package initializes to display both the 
model version and coefficients version.

* removed strset which is not ANSI compliant and replaced with memset 
which is ANSI compliant. 

* Added compliance with building for R 2.14.0 as all packages now need a namespace. 


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0-6

* This NEWS file was added.

A variant was added (CONIFERS_SWOHYBRID), developed by Martin Ritchie, of 
USDA FS at PSW Redding, to examine the influence of climate model variables 
in the CONIFERS_SWO simulator.

* The code for the fill_in_missing values function was modified to better 
accomodate the multiple variants.


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0-6

* We have made two changes to the Rconifers package. The first was a
simple documentation change. Users must now include data with all
fields identified, even if they contain only missing values. The
simulator assumes input data with all fields properly labeled and will
now respond with a warning message if this condition is not met.

* The second change involved the genetic gain component of the simulator
which operates only on the SMC variant, and only on Douglas-fir. The
Rconifers package will now accept the switch to turn on this feature
(use_genetic_gain).

* The new version of the R package is version 1.0.3, and can be loaded
from the CRAN site in the usual manner. If you encounter any problems
with the package, please contact me at the email below.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.0-5 AND BEFORE

* We have released a new version of the simulator: Version 4.12. There
is only one change in this version. The installation routine is now
Microsoft Windows enabled. The actual code has not undergone any
change and results should be the same as the earlier version (4.11).

* The URL below is the site to visit if you want to download version 4.12:
